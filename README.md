# Jekyll code for website of Electronics and Robotics Club IIT Bombmay
The Jekyll code for the ERC website resides in this repo.

The Electronics and Robotics Club is coming up under [STAB, IITB](https://stab-iitb.org/) very soon.
Originally, we were two separate clubs, but redundancy drove us into a merger. Cheers!
