# Jekyll code for website of Electronics and Robotics Club IIT Bombay
The Jekyll code for the ERC@IITB website resides in this repo.

The Electronics and Robotics Club is coming up under [STAB, IITB](https://stab-iitb.org/) very soon.
Originally, we were two separate clubs, but redundancy drove us into a merger. Cheers!
