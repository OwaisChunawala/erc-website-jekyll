**ATMELâ€™s AVR** Series of Microcontrollers is a very good option for
those who wish to use the microcontrollers to their true potential,
**exploiting every bit of functionality** they can offer. Learning them
requires you to sometimes indulge into the **internal aspects** of
microcontrollers. Registers, Binary Numbers all play a major role in
operating these microcontrollers in their hardcore form. They form the
heart of the Arduino Microcontrollers you might have learned earlier.

The AVR Series has many microcontrollers which vary in their processing
capacity(Speed) and Memory. Throughout this tutorial we shall consider
ATMega16 as our sample.

(ATMega32: 8-bit AVR Processor, 16 kbytes flash memory)
