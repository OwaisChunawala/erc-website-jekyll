### Keep Tinkering!

Keep thinking of applications of the mentioned features.

 - As a basic example, this could enable you to take readings of some
physical quantity from sensors that return analog values, execute
ADC(inbuilt) and give Pulse Width Modulated output to motors. So, you
can use Arduino as the motor driver, and make the **Line Follower Bot**!
 - Arduino can be used in many small projects when coupled with a
**General Purpose Input/Output board**, typically having LEDs, Switches,
Potentiometer, Buzzer, LDR, TSOP IR Receiver, Temperature Sensor(LM35D)
etc elements.

### The Open-Source Advantage

You can follow the official [Arduino Blog](https://blog.arduino.cc/)
for ideas, or explore the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/)
for in-depth understanding of Arduino!

Thank you.
