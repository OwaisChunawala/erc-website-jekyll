[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is a great open-source electronics prototyping
platform based on flexible easy-to-use hardware and software. It is basically a simplified
microcontroller, in the sense that it uses a normal microcontroller and
**envelopes its internal functioning** which may impede its functioning,
but it gives us a very handy, easy to use tool. It is also much
simplified as compared to other microcontrollers, because the preset
standards/code in any Arduino eliminates the need to know the internal
details of the microcontroller before using/programming it.

In order to get the best out of this tutorial, please read through the
links which you are asked to refer in the following text(Other links are
for detailed information only). This will furnish you with the
information required to understand the examples mentioned.

### Why Arduino

1.  Uses ATMEL AVR Microcontrollers, which give excellent performance at
    cheap cost.
2.  Has built-in ADC,PWM Pins.
3.  Open Source!
4.  For us, it is the most easy microcontroller to start with, which you
    will see in some time :)
